# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

## Approach
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?*

I had never used an API before so I had to research to find some tutorials, at first I tried to use online blog posts but I found I was struggling to know what to search as I was not familiar with a lot of the terminology to do with APIs. I then decided to use YouTube to look up some tutorials on the topic and found that was very useful as the videos explained each step line by line making it easier for me to understand. I found a tutorial that did something similar to what I needed to do and then adapted it to work with the API provided.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

I’m particularly proud that I learnt how to make API calls and bring data to the frontend as this is something I had never done before but I was excited to take on the challenge and learn this new skill. I attempted to make the API calls multiple times and then encountered the issue of the localhost server not being connected to the network. To resolve this issue I restarted the virtual environment hosting the API and then pasted in the code I had written previously, which fixed the problem. At first I decided I would try to get each objective to work, then I would have worked on enhancing the features if I had more time. I felt the most important thing to do was make a start on each task.

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

I faced the issue of not knowing how to make API calls, so I wasn’t really sure where to start, to solve this problem. I broke the tasks down and focused on one aspect at a time, first finding a way to display the data from the API on the frontend. To do this I found a tutorial online that explained how to do this really well and using the tutorial as a reference, I adapted the example code to work with the API data provided. I then moved on to the task of sending data to the backend. I found a tutorial to make a POST request with fetch to allow me to send data input by the user to the backend and I adapted it to fit with what I wanted it to do.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*

Overall, I am happy that I was able to make an API call to bring data from the backend to the frontend. I was unable to get the push aspect of the code to work as I ran out of time but I am pleased that I made a start with the code and knew what I would have done if I had more time to research and complete the task. Given more time I would have included some design to the frontend as it is quite simple at the moment and I decided to focus on the functionality of the code before I improved the visual features of the webpage. I would also implement error handling so that the program correctly handles missing or invalid data as I wasn’t able to implement the code to do that in time.
